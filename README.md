# Firefly SMS Parser

Firefly SMS Parser is a tool designed to extract and process text from SMS messages, including those embedded in images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and AI technologies.

## Features

- Extracts text from SMS messages and images
- Utilizes advanced OCR and AI models for high accuracy
- Easy integration into existing workflows

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/athphane/firefly-sms-parser.git
cd firefly-sms-parser
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Environmental Impact

> **Note:** Each time an image is processed with OCR and AI, it can consume a significant amount of computational powerâ€”sometimes more than what a small village in Africa might use in a day. Please use this tool responsibly and be mindful of its energy consumption.
